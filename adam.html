Dr. Bernstein works on the development of radiation detectors for applications in nuclear
nonproliferation and nuclear arms control, and on detector development for fundamental physics
experiments. He received his B.A. in Physics from the University of California at Berkeley, and
his Ph.D. in Experimental High Energy Physics from Columbia University. Over the last few years,
he has pioneered the use of cubic meter scale detectors as a practical means for non-intrusive
real-time measurement of changes in the plutonium content of operating reactors. The technology
can be used in the International Atomic Energy Agency's reactor safeguards. Bernstein has also
developed large-scale liquid scintillator detectors for improved passive and active detection of
Plutonium and Highly Enriched Uranium. In 2005, Discover Magazine cited Bernstein's and
co-investigators' work on rapid detection of fissile material in cargo as one of the top hundred
most significant scientific stories of the year.  He is a member of the Double Chooz experiment,
an international collaboration which will directly measure or place the world's most stringent
limit on the neutrino oscillation parameter theta13.
