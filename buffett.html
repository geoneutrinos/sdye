<b>Abstract:</b> 
Paleomagnetic measurements show that the Earth has possessed a magnetic 
field for at least 3 billion years. The persistence of the field requires 
continual regeneration because ohmic losses would otherwise dissipate the 
field in less than 105 years. The precise nature of the dynamo process is 
poorly understood, although it is probably driven by vigorous convection 
in the electrically conducting, liquid outer core. A supply of energy is 
needed to power the dynamo, and the most important sources are usually 
associated with cooling and solidification of the core. Some of the energy 
available to the dynamo arises through latent-heat release on 
solidification and through the associated generation of compositional 
buoyancy by exclusion of light elements from the iron-rich solid inner 
core. Other possible sources of energy include the thermal energy 
associated with cooling and radioactive heat sources.

The power required to operate the dynamo places tight constraints on the 
heat flow from the core. If the heat flow is too low, thermal convection 
is shut off and the rate of generation of compositional buoyancy by 
solidification becomes too low to drive the dynamo. Conversely, a high 
heat flow causes rapid growth of the inner core, so that convection prior 
to the appearance of the inner core must be sustained by thermal buoyancy 
alone. The attendant requirements on primordial heat become more severe as 
the age of the inner core decreases. Present-day estimates of heat flow 
from the core satisfy the power requirements for the dynamo. However, the 
resulting thermal histories predict implausibly hot conditions in the 
early Earth.

One way to reduce the high temperatures at early times is to add 
radioactive heat sources to the core. Additional heat sources slow the 
rate of cooling of the core, which lowers the core temperature as we 
extrapolate back in time.  For example, a potassium concentration of 
several hundred parts per million (by weight) provides enough heat from 
the decay of 40K to eliminate the problems with the thermal histories. 
Another way to reduce the high temperature at early time is to lower the 
heat flow from the core. This can be accomplished without a substantial 
revision of the current core temperature by accumulating heat-producing 
elements in a layer immediately above the core (e.g. the D" region).  
Limits on the concentration of heat-producing elements in such a layer are 
set by the minimum heat flow needed to run the dynamo. Given the 
uncertainty in the power consumption of the dynamo, it is possible to find 
reasonable thermal histories that rely entirely on the presence on 
heat-producing elements in a layer above the core.
