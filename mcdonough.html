<b>Abstract:</b>
Estimating the composition of the Earth and that of its differentiated 
parts (core, mantle, curst) requires integrating physics and chemistry of 
the Earth with cosmochemical insights; this approach is not without 
controversy nor considerable uncertainties.  The earth's composition is 
the integrated product of that which condensed and accreted from a 
collapsing, co-rotating solar nebula, with accreted materials having had 
residence in or transited across the 1AU region of the solar system.  The 
guiding principals for estimating the planet's composition are (1) to 
constrain models to be consistent with physical observations of the planet 
(i.e. density profile (seismology), moment of inertia (geodesy), 
magnetosphere and paleomagnetic record (geomagnetism)), (2) to use 
chondrites (undifferentiated meteorites) to constrain the relative 
abundances of refractory elements (high temperature condensates, ~40 
elements) in planets and to provide perspective on redox and volatility 
processes during parent body formation, and (3) to use mantle and crustal 
rocks to identify the behavior of elements during differentiation.  The 
composition of the crust and mantle (silicate earth) is initially 
established from these principles followed by a model for the bulk planet.  
With these results the core composition is calculated based on a mass 
balance relationship between bulk planet and the silicate shell.

The principle uncertainties in developing compositional models for the 
earth and its reservoirs (core, mantle, curst) come from (1) variations in 
the compositions of crust and mantle samples, (2) variations in the 
compositions of chondritic meteorites, and (3) the intrinsically biased 
nature of the samples we have for analyses.  There is a constant concern 
as to whether we have sampled/identified/characterized the full range of 
components in the earth (i.e., are there hidden reservoirs with an 
important complement of elements?). The chemical variability in mantle 
samples leads to a range of compositional models derived from 
reconstructing mantle melting trends.  This, in turn, yields uncertainties 
in the absolute concentrations of elements in the earth.  An important 
goal of these models is establishing the absolute concentrations of the 
refractory elements, given the accepted paradigm of planets having 
chondritic proportions of these elements.  Underpinning our models are the 
critical observations provided by several radiogenic isotope systems 
(i.e., 146Sm- 142Nd, 147Sm-143Nd, 176Lu-176Hf, 206Pb-208Pb) that 
demonstrate the silicate earth to have chondritic proportions of 
refractory elements.  Thorium and uranium are refractory elements and 
therefore knowing their absolute abundances places tight constraints on 
the planetary production of geoneutrinos.  Present modeling sets the 
planetary abundances of refractory elements at ~1.8 times that of C1 
chondrites abundances, with ~80 and ~20 ng/g of Th and U, respectively, in 
the silicate earth and no Th and U in the core.

A critical concern regarding the composition of the planet focuses on the 
role of radioactive elements in the energy budget of the earth.  There is 
a desire by some to have radiogenic heating in the core in order to find 
an energy balance for the earth.  The power needed to drive the geodynamo, 
as based on the heat flow from the core with no radioactive heating, is 
believed to be insufficient over the history of the earth, as constrained 
from the existence of ancient rocks with a record of strong magnetic 
fields and their implications for the presence of an inner core.  In 
contrast, however, other models posit that less power is needed to drive 
the geodynamo because of how ohmic losses are treated; these models are 
finding that no radiogenic heating is required to drive the geodynamo.   
Petrological experiments that report on the possibility of radioactive 
elements being sequestered into in the core are simply plausibility 
arguments that permit, but do not require, the presence of such components 
in the core or other regions of the earth's deep interior.  Plausibility 
arguments such as these must be coupled with corroborating evidence that 
are free of negating chemical consequences.
<br><br>
A second concern comes from the perceived limited contribution of 
radioactive heating to the total power output of the planet.  It is 
generally recognized that the global heat flow appears to be twice as 
strong as that derived from radiogenic heating of the earth (i.e., a Urey 
number of ~0.5, based on conventional compositional models of the earth 
(as above).  However, more recent modeling has concluded that the widely 
accepted value of 44 TW for the surface heat loss is too high and that 
this value is more likely ~31 TW.  Consequently, this finding implies a 
higher Urey number for the above compositional model for heat-producing 
elements in the earth.  An alternative compositional model has a Urey 
number of ~1 and a core composition that contains K and U.

Testing compositional models for the earth requires insights from a wide 
range of geophysical, geochemical and cosmochemical studies.  Results from 
the KamLAND experiment, as well as from other geoneutrino detectors, are 
critical in establishing the abundances and distribution of radioactive 
elements in the earth, which in turn provide additional insights into the 
absolute abundances of the refractory and volatile elements in the planet.  
I will summarize a series of recent experiments that we conducted that 
specifically examine the potential of extracting long-live radioactive 
elements into the core.
