<b>Abstract:</b> The multi-disciplinary programme EARTH (Earth 
AntineutRino 
TomograpHy) 
aims at mapping radiogenic heat sources in the Earth's Interior with 
ultimately an angular resolution of about 3 degrees. Similar to medical 
tomography this 3-D image is obtained by placing a number (~10) of 
detector arrangements (antennas) over the Earth's surface. With such an 
angular resolution the spatial resolution for objects at the Earth's 
centre or at the core/mantle boundary becomes 300, respectively 150-200km. 
This will provide unprecedented information on radiogenic heat sources as 
engines in the machinery of the Earth's Interior. The first antenna is 
planned to be installed at Curaçao, Dutch Antilles.<br>
	Antennas are designed to contain a mass of about 4kilotonnes of 
solid scintillation material. Contrary to the KamLAND detector or the ones 
planned for Borexino, LENA, Hawaii, or Baksan, all monolithic, spherical 
arrangements. Angular resolution can only be obtained with small sized 
detectors, the EARTH antennas will be modular and will consist of many 
modules, each containing a large number of rod-shaped detector units. The 
inverse beta-decay results in a positron and a neutron. The positron is 
almost emitted isotropically, carries almost the full available energy, 
and is almost instantaneously stopped. The neutron initially carries the 
direction information of the incident antineutrino, but tends to lose this 
energy in subsequent collisions with predominantly H nuclei. Geoneutrino 
detection hence becomes a problem of neutron tracking and small becomes 
comparable to the distance neutrons travel (a few centimetres). 
Addition of 10B reduces this loss of direction significantly. Moreover it 
shortens the time between positron detection and neutron capture and 
produces an alpha-particle of almost constant energy. Neutron tracking 
simulations indicate an angular resolution ranging with incident angle 
from 15 degrees (axial) to 60 degrees (radial) for small-size detectors. 
The 
requirements of delayed coincidence within 2 microseconds in one or two 
adjacent 
detector units, a spatial separation of the coincident events of <5cm, the 
constant alpha-particle energy, differences in pulse shape and the reduced 
sensitivity to muons (simultaneous detection in more than two units) is 
expected to reduce background by a factor 10^9-10^12. These restrictions 
are 
also thought to reduce significantly our sensitivity to the 13C(alpha,n) 
reaction.<br>
To achieve our ambitions the University of Groningen, the foundation for 
Astronomical research ASTRON and a private, Curaçao foundation JADE. They 
jointly with physicist of South Africa, industries in the Netherlands and 
geoscientists in the Netherlands and Germany have started the development 
of the detector units, their electronics and the geological suitability of 
the antenna. Depending on the reduction of sensitivity to cosmic induced 
background the antenna will consist of several directionally drilled 
shafts or will be placed in a shallow underground laboratory. In a shallow 
underground laboratory the antenna can be "focussed" on certain hotspots 
for more detailed information.
