<b>Title:</b> HYPER SCINTILLATION DETECTOR (HSD): Next Generation Detector 
for keV to GeV Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Geophysics<br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> I will survey the arguments advanced in current studies 
for a 50-100 kT 
liquid scintillation detector for observing keV to GeV phenomena with wide 
multidisciplinary scientific impact. This approach competes effectively 
with other large scale detectors such  as Cerenkov and Liquid Argon. The 
Homestake laboratory at 4850 feet depth that is expected to be ready in 
2007 may be a well-matched  site for HSD.
