<b>Title:</b> Experimental status of geo-reactor search
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> Existence of a natural nuclear fission reactor inside
the Earth's core has been proposed as an energy source that powers
Earth's magnetic field. Geo-reactor model implies existence of electron
anti-neutrinos from the core with energy spectrum characterized by those
produced in commercial fission reactors. The putative geo-reactor could be 
observed by the Kamioka liquid scintillator anti-neutrino detector 
(KamLAND) and its power, which is
proportional to the rate of emission of anti-neutrinos, could be measured. 
Here we present the first attempt at detecting the geo-reactor power.
