<b>Abstract:</b> With recent progress in the simulation of elastic wave
propagation in realistic 3D earth models combined with significant
increases in computational power, seismologists are well positioned to 
start
fully exploiting the wealth of information about earth structure and 
dynamics
contained in a rapidly expanding database of high quality broadband 
seismic
waveforms, accumulated globally and regionally over the last twenty five
years.
<br><br>
Global seismic tomography of the earth's mantle - and particularly the
lower mantle - has traditionally focused on the inversion of travel times
from a small number of seismic phases, well isolated in time domain 
seismograms.
The resulting uneven sampling of the earth, dictated by the available
distribution of earthquake sources and receivers, greatly
limits the resolution of 3D structure that can be attained. Waveform
tomography, on the other hand, allows one to include information from
the entire wavefield generated by an earthquake, in a wide frequency band,
provided adequate finite frequency kernels are employed.
<br><br>
I will first introduce some key unresolved issues in global
dynamics of the earth's interior, that seismic tomography
can help address. I will review the current status of
global mantle tomography, contrasting images obtained using
different datasets and inversion methodologies, and discussing
their various strengths and limitations.
<br><br>
I will point out how features associated with the downgoing
convective flow appear better understood at the present time
than those associated with upwellings. I will then describe
how new waveform inversion and forward modeling approaches can lead to
significant progress in seismic imaging of "hotter" regions, and 
illustrate
how the combination of elastic, anelastic and anisotropic forward
 and inverse modeling provides complementary constraints
on the structure and dynamics of the mantle, and in particular
 on such questions as what is the morphology and the nature of
  the lower mantle "superplumes", their  relation to "hotspots" and their
role in the global mantle circulation?
