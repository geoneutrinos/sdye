<b>Title:</b> Implications of Neutrino Geophysics to the Earth Sciences
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> Neutrino geophysics has the potential to provide hard 
constraints on 
questions relating to the formulation, evolution, and long-term 
habitability of planets.  For the immediate future, the unwieldy logistics 
of neutrino detection mandates asking simple questions and taking 
advantage of what is already known about the Earth.  With regard to 
antineutrinos generated by U and Th decay, it is productive to partition 
the earth into continental crust, mantle (including the oceanic crust), 
and the core (which is expected to have no U or Th).  The continents are 
complexly heterogeneous and much more radioactive that the mantle.  Their 
effect on the computed mantle radioactivity can be lessened by having the 
antineutrino detector in the middle of an ocean basin or by having two 
detectors different distances from a continental margin.  The amount of 
radioactive heat production of some continental locations, like South 
Africa, is known from studies of rocks (called xenoliths) brought up by 
diamond pipes that give temperature and hence heat flow as a function of 
depth.  Radioactive heat production balances the difference between 
surface and mantle heat flow as these stable regions are near steady 
state.  Once antineutrino studies yield the U and Th concentration in the 
mantle, arguments by geochemists traditionally used to constrain them can 
be turned around.  The cooling rate of the Earth's interior (a topic 
dating back to Lord Kelvin) controls the duration of active tectonics on 
our planet.  Knowing average U and Th concentrations calibrates models of 
mantle melting beneath midoceanic ridges and cosmochemical models of the 
Earth's accretion from the solar nebula.   In more detail, several 
antineutrino detectors would tell if the mantle was laterally 
heterogeneous with a thick layer of dregs in the lower 1000 km.  Potassium 
detectors would tell if there is a significant hidden reservoir of this 
element in the deep mantle or core.  X-raying the Earth with neutrinos 
provides valuable information when combined with seismic data.  The 
studies take advantage of the fact that neutrinos move in known straight 
lines while the paths of seismic waves are not known precisely.  The 
absolute depth to the Earth's core is a potential application.
