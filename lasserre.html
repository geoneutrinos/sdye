<b>Title:</b> Next Generation of Reactor Neutrino Experiments : 
Detector Developements,
Scintillating Oils and Compatible Materials
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> New reactor neutrino experiments are being planned and 
will be built in the
forthcoming years. Eventhough not dedicated to geo-neutrino detection, 
those experiments
are based on the same experimental methods. Pushing the current technology 
to the limits
they plan to reach an unprecedented precision, thanks to a careful 
reduction and control
of the systematic errors below the percent. Experience achieved by such 
projects as well
as technical innovations could be valuable for future geo-neutrino 
experiments. After
discussing the detector design of the next reactor experiments, I will 
focus on the
progresses achieved on the scintillating oils and compatible materials.
