<b>Abstract:</b>
A viable attempt at demonstrating sensitivity in a large mass
detector to the ultra-low energy recoils expected from coherent 
neutrino-nucleus elastic scattering is described. The applications of such 
a device to fundamental and applied physics (e.g., non-proliferation) are 
numerous: the coherent enhancement to the neutral current cross section 
predicted for this mode of interaction results in recoil rates in the 
hundreds per kg-day from reactor antineutrinos. This would afford a 
radical neutrino detector compactification, giving meaning to the 
expression ``neutrino technology.'' A roadmap is delineated that 
addresses the crucial points of demonstrating a low-enough energy 
threshold in a ~1 kg target, a sufficiently-low background for a reactor 
measurement, and a full understanding of detector response in this 
yet-unexplored sub-keV energy range. To achieve these, a high-purity 
monochromatic 24-keV neutron beam and calibration setup has been
built and characterized at the Kansas State University TRIGA Mark-II 
reactor. Two detector technologies presently under test will be described, 
together with first results on their response to sub-keV recoils. The 
possibility of an immediate test in the San Onofre reactor tendon gallery 
will be assessed.
