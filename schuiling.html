<b>Abstract:</b>
M.Herndon, in a series of papers, has proposed that a nuclear reactor is 
operating at the center of the Earth. Part of his hypothesis is based on 
the idea that the composition of the Earth is not, as usually assumed, 
essentially chondritic, but has a more reduced composition comparable to 
enstatite chondrites. The small amount of uranium in the molten metal 
will, probably in the form of a uranium sulfide, migrate to the center of 
the core. Herndon also assumes that there is a need for an extra heat 
source, as the total heat leaving the core is stated to be more than can 
be accounted for by "classical" heat sources.<br><br>
In this contribution we will review the different hypotheses by comparing 
the formation and composition of the Earth as commonly assumed with 
Herndon's model Earth, and seek to answer the question whether nuclear 
georeactors at the Earth's center are plausible, or at least possible.
