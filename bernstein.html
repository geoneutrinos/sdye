<b>Title:</b> Monitoring of Reactors for IAEA and other Reactor Safeguards
Regimes
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> Reactor antineutrino detection has matured to the point
where it is feasible to stably monitor plutonium content and reactor
power  using a high statistics (hundreds or thousands of counts per
day) cubic meter scale antineutrino detector at a standoff of a few
tens of meters. Our Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory/Sandia
National Laboratories collaboration has deployed a detector to
demonstrate this capability at a 3.4 GWt pressurized water reactor in
Southern California, operating 25 meters from the core center, and
acquiring data over an approximate one year period. Such monitoring
may be useful for nonintrusively tracking power output and plutonium
buildup in nuclear reactors, providing the earliest possible
measurement of the amount of plutonium in the reactor core.  We
present our antineutrino event sample, and show that  the fast
short-term changes and slow long term changes in antineutrino rate
are respectively consistent with known changes in reactor power
through outages and with the expected long-term systematic decline in
rate induced by ingrowth of plutonium as the reactor proceeds through
its cycle. We estimate the attainable precision of the method, and
discuss the benefits this technology may have for the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards regime.
