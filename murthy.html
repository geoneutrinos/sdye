<b>Abstract:</b>
The four most important radioactive nuclides responsible for heat 
production in the Earth are 40K, 235U, 238U and 232Th.  Conventional 
wisdom relegates the bulk inventory of these elements exclusively to the 
silicate Crust and the Mantle (Bulk Silicate Earth -BSE), leaving the 
metallic Core devoid of any radioactivity.  This point of view stems from 
the known geochemical behavior in the upper parts of the Earth where these 
elements tend to partition preferentially and almost exclusively into 
silicates relative to Fe-metal.  However, several recent experiments 
clearly demonstrate that partition coefficients are a function of pressure 
and temperature.  Thus it is possible that the geochemical behavior of 
these radioactive elements may be quite different in the deep Earth below 
a few hundred kilometers due to the ambient conditions of high pressure 
and temperature.  Of the elements listed above, K is the only element for 
which some experimental data and theoretical calculations are available to 
suggest its presence in the metallic Core.

The suggestion that K can be sequestered into a sulfur-bearing core is 
more than 
30 years old (Lewis, 1971; Hall and Murthy, 1971). Subsequent theoretical 
quantum mechanics calculations (Bukowinski, 1976) suggested that K 
undergoes an electronic structure change at high pressures and behaves 
more like a transition metal, faciltating alloy formation with Fe.  These 
suggestions remained controversial because of strong adherence to 
convention as well as the many ambiguous and contradictory experimental 
results until recently.  This picture has now changed due to new 
experimental work and theoretical calculations.  Murthy <i>et al.</i> (2003) 
showed unambiguously that K can enter Fe-FeS melts in a strongly 
temperature dependent fashion and attributed previous ambiguous results to 
experimental artifacts.  Using ultramafic silicate compositions and Fe-FeS 
mixtures, Gessmann and Wood (2002) have argued for entry of Na and K into 
sulfide melts. The magnitude of the partition coefficient is such that 
significant K can enter and act as a heat source in the core.  Lee and 
Jeanloz (2003) have observed solubility of K in Fe-metal at pressures >26 
GPa. More recently, Hirao <i>et al.</i> (2005, personal 
communication) report on partition of K in to Fe-metal at 134 GPa and 
3500 K, conditions directly relevant to the core-mantle boundary.  These 
experimental data  have been bolstered by new molecular 
dynamics calculations (Parker <i>et al.</i>, 1997, Lee <i>et al.</i>, 2003)
<br><br>
These new results certainly bear upon the question of radioactivity of the 
Core but in themselves cannot precisely define how much radioactivity or 
how much K is in the Core.  This is still an open question.  The present 
experimental data suggest a range of about a few hundred parts per 
million, but the estimates are dependent on assumed initial composition of 
the Earth, models of core formation and partition data extrapolated to 
high pressure and temperature.  Our knowledge of the radioactive contents 
of the Mantle and the Core are still largely model-dependent.  Viewed in 
this context, the possibility of using geoneutrino flux to assess the 
radioactivity of the Mantle and Core is exciting, and likely to provide 
vital information that touches on many important aspects of the Earth - 
early differentiation, Core formation, thermal evolution, global dynamics 
and geomagnetism, to name a few.
