<b>Title:</b> Hawaii Anti-Neutrino Observatory
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> The Hawaii Anti-Neutrino Observatory (Hanohano) is 
uniquely 
sited to measure the flux of geo-neutrinos from Earth's mantle (plus core) 
and to test for a possible geo-reactor at Earth's core.  The sensitivity 
of Hanohano to various fluxes of electron anti-neutrinos from Earth is 
presented.
