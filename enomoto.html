<b>Abstract:</b>
The Kamioka liquid scintillator anti-neutrino detector (KamLAND), which 
consists of 1000 tones of ultra-pure liquid scintillator surrounded by 
1879 photo-multiplier tubes (PMT), is the first detector sensitive enough 
to detect geoneutrinos. Earth models suggest that KamLAND observes 
geoneutrinos at a rate of 30 events/10^32-protons/year from the 238U decay 
chain, and 8 events/10^32-protons/year from the 232Th decay chain. With 
7.09×10^31 proton-years of detector exposure and detection efficiency of  
0.687±0.007, the 'rate-only' analysis gives  geoneutrino candidates. 
Assuming a Th/U mass concentration ratio of 3.9, the 'rate + shape' 
analysis gives the 90 per cent confidence interval for the total number of 
geoneutrinos detected to be from 4.5 to 54.2. This result is consistent 
with predictions from the Earth models. The 99% C.L. upper limit is set at 
1.45×10^-31 events per target proton per year, which is 3.8 times higher 
than the central value of the model prediction that gives 16 TW of 
radiogenic heat production from 238U and 232Th. Although the present data 
have limited statistical power, they provide by direct means an upper 
limit for the Earth's radiogenic heat of U and Th.
