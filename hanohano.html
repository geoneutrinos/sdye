Large Scintillating Liquid Detector
</h3>

<p> A large scintillating liquid detector with modest energy threshold and 
resolution is capable of significant multidisciplinary science. The 
specific suite of scientific measurements depends on detector location. 
Many of the potential measurements are possible with the proposed 50 
kiloton LENA project at the Pyhasalmi mine in Finland. Deployment of a 
similar detector in the deep ocean accesses unique geosciences 
measurements without sacrificing any on the LENA program. The following 
describes some of the scientific measurements possible with a 50 kiloton 
scintillating liquid detector deployed in the deep ocean.

The deep ocean detector would efficiently detect antineutrinos from the 
natural decay series of uranium-238 and thorium-232. These antineutrinos, 
which are called geo-neutrinos, have energies of less than 3.3 MeV. The 
interaction rate of geo-neutrinos in a 50 kiloton detector located in the 
deep ocean far from continents and nuclear reactors is predicted to be 
high enough to uniquely sample radioactivity in the mantle. Such sampling 
is not possible with continental detectors due to systematic uncertainties 
associated with the predicted distribution of radioactivity in the 
lithosphere. Of significant importance are measurements that constrain 
radiogenic heating in the mantle, resolve the predicted sub-chondritic 
thorium to uranium elemental ratio in the mantle, and probe radioactivity 
levels in seismically-resolved structures (LLSVPs) in the deep mantle.

Astrophysics
</h3>

A significant source of antineutrinos with energy above 10 MeV and below 
30 MeV is all past core-collapse supernovae. Measuring these 
antineutrinos, which are known as the diffuse supernova neutrino 
background and relic supernova neutrinos, and their energy spectrum probes 
the rate of star formation in the universe at different epochs. One 
challenge of this as yet unrealized measurement is identification of 
neutral current quasi-elastic atmospheric neutrino interactions. The 
energy range of 10 - 30 MeV is set by background from nuclear reactors at 
the low end and from charged current atmospheric neutrino interactions at 
the high end. An advantage of the deep oceean detector is the opportunity 
for deployment at locations minimizing the fluxes of antineutrinos from 
reactors and the atmosphere, thereby enhancing sensitivity to relic 
supernova neutrinos. </p>

Particle Physics
</h3>

The unification of the strong and electroweak forces in the very early 
universe is an important prediction of supersymmetric grand unified 
theory. A clear signature of this prediction is proton decay to neutrino 
plus kaon. Large scintillating liquid detetors, such as LENA, have unique 
sensitivity to the kaon mode of proton decay. Experimental evidence for 
supersymmetric grand unification indicates an explanation for the 
dominance of matter over antimatter in the unverse by the process of 
leptogenesis. </p>

The discovery of flavor conversion of solar neutrinos by the 
LMA-MSW-predicted survival probability clearly establishes the mixing of 
neutrino flavor states and mass states. Deviations of the predicted 
survival probability in the energy spectrum of boron-8 solar neutrinos are 
sensitive probes of new physics, such as non-standard neutrino 
interactions and light sterile neutrinos. A large, self-shielding 
scintillating liquid detector, like LENA, has the ability to measure the 
boron-8 solar neutrino energy spectrum between 2 and 4 MeV, which is the 
region where deviations from the LMA MSW prediction indicate new physics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Cosmic Rays
</h3>

The flux of secondary cosmic rays, including atmospheric neutrinos, at the 
surface of Earth is strongly influenced by the geomagnetic field. In 
addition to being a major source of background for experiments searching 
for nuclean decay and relic supernova neutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos 
encode Earth matter effects with sensitivity to neutrino mass ordering. A 
large scintillting liquid detetor in the deep ocean offers an opportunity 
to measure atmospheric neutrinos at various geomagnetic latitudes for 
improving experimental sensitivities by validating calculated predictions. 
</p>

A significant source of background for experiments operating with an 
overburden of less than 5 km of water equivalent is cosmic ray muons. 
Cosmic ray muons produce fast neutrons and nuclear spallation, which 
interfere with measurements of many rare processes. The production rates 
of fast neutron and nuclear spallation, which depend on the flux and 
average energy of cosmic ray muons at the detector, are typically 
calculated from emprical data based on estimates of overburden and 
material properties of surrounding material. A large scintillating liquid 
detector, which is readily deployed at varying depth at specific 
geomagnetic latitudes, is capable of measuring the production rates of 
fast neutrons and nuclear spallation of carbon. Such measurements improve 
sensitivity to rare processes by validating and adding precision to the 
calculated estimates at other sites.

Reactor Antineutrinos
</h3>

Nuclear reactors are intense sources of electron antineutrinos. 
Observations of reactor antineutrinos contribute important information on 
neutrino properties and have applications for nuclear non-proliferation. A 
useful website for predicting the reactor antineutrino interation rate and 
energy spectrum near Earth's surface is here:

<h2 align=left> Ocean Bottom KamLAND </h2>

<p align=left> Ocean Bottom KamLAND (OBK) is a proposed large liquid 
scintillation detector designed to be transportable on the ocean surface, 
deployable to great depths, and recoverable for operation at different 
locations. At 50 kilotons of target mass it is capable of 
multidisciplinary science, including geology, astrophysics, particle 
physics, and cosmic rays. When deployed to depths of 6 kilometers or more, 
background due to cosmic ray muons is virtually eliminated. </p>

<h2 align=left> Hawaii Anti-Neutrino Observatory </h2> 

<p align=left> 

HANOHANO is a proposed 10 kiloton liquid scintillation detector designed 
to be transportable and deployable in the deep ocean.  For particle 
physics use it can be positioned ~50km offshore from a reactor complex and 
make measurements of the unknown neutrino oscillations mixing angle 
theta_13.  Moreover if this angle is not too small, then it can determine 
the neutrino mass hierarchy, in a means not dependent upon matter effects, 
and relatively insensitive to systematic effects.

</p> The other goal is to measure for the first time the neutrino flux 
from uranium and thorium from the Earth's mantle.  This opens a new field, 
after the initial geoneutrino detections from KamLAND, and will help solve 
the mystery of the source of heat in the Earth. The heat which drives 
tectonics and the geomagnetic field remains controversial in source and 
magnitude. 

</p> Initial engineering and design studies have been carried 
out, along with some critical laboratory tests, and feasibility has been 
established.

Neutrino Oscillation Studies 
</h3> 
We describe a method for determining the hierarchy of the neutrino mass 
spectrum and theta_13 through remote detection of electron antineutrinos 
from a nuclear reactor. This method utilizing a single, 10-kiloton 
scintillating liquid detector at a distance of 50-64 kilometers from the 
reactor complex measures mass-squared differences involving nu_3 with a 
one (ten) year exposure provided sin^2(2theta_13)>0.05 (0.02). Our 
technique applies the Fourier transform to the event rate as a function of 
neutrino flight distance over neutrino energy. Sweeping over a relevant 
range of delta_m^2 resolves separate spectral peaks for delta_m^2_31 and 
delta_m^2_32. For normal (inverted) hierarchy |delta_m^2_31| is greater 
(lesser) than |delta_m^2_32|.  This robust determination requires a 
detector energy resolution of 3.5%/sqrt(E).

Geoneutrino Studies </h3>
The Hawaii Anti-Neutrino Observatory (Hanohano) is a deep 
ocean project to detect natural neutrinos throughout the 
<a href="earth-struct.jpg">Earth </a>
and its core. 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0609041"> (Link to arXiv paper) </a>  
Natural neutrinos (anti-electron neutrinos) arise from the decay of 
radioactive isotopes of uranium, thorium, and potassium in the crust and 
mantle (geo-neutrinos) and possibly from a 
<a href="http://www.nuclearplanet.com">nuclear reactor in the core</a> 
(geo-reactor neutrinos).  
The spectrum of neutrinos from the decay chains of uranium and thorium
extends above the energy threshold for inverse neutron decay (1.8 
MeV).  Detection (background reduction) is facilitated by the delayed 
coincidence signal from the capture of the neutron.  Potassium neutrinos 
are below threshold for this reaction. <br><br>
The detector concept is similar to that employed by the operating 
<a href="http://www.awa.tohoku.ac.jp/KamLAND/">KamLAND</a> 
experiment in Japan.  Detection of inverse neutron decay using 
scintillation liquid viewed by photomultiplier tubes is traditional, 
starting with the seminal experiments of 
<a href="reinescontrols.jpg">Reines and 
Cowan</a>.  The KamLAND experiment, which is situated for observing 
neutrinos from nuclear power reactors, demonstrates the capability for 
detecting lower energy geo-neutrinos.  The geo-neutrino signal at the 
KamLAND site originates primarily from radioactive elements in the 
continental crust. <br><br>

To reduce 
background from nuclear power reactors and to gain sensitivity to 
radioactive elements in Earth's mantle Hanohano is placed on the oceanic 
crust near Hawaii.  There are significant engineering challenges 
associated with operating a sophisticated detector in a remote, deep ocean 
environment.  Physicists and geologists at the 
<a href="http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/">University of Hawaii</a>, 
<a href="http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/">Tohoku University</a>, the 
<a href="http://www.ua.edu/">University of Maryland</a>, and others along 
with engineers at <a href="http://www.makai.com/">Makai Ocean 
Engineering</a> are investigating these challenges and developing 
solutions.
