<b>Title:</b>
Vertex reconstruction improvement in KamLAND and prospects for geoneutrino
directionality analysis.
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
It has been shown that, in double-coincidence antineutrino experiments,
the direction of incident antineutrinos is correlated with the vector
between the prompt and delayed signals. This, in principle, makes it
possible to determine the direction to the antineutrino source by means
of directionality analysis which, once implemented, would be especially
important for neutrino geophysics. However, due mostly to the limited
available statistics, the practical feasibility of such a study is not
guaranteed. Discussed are the prospects of geoneutrino directionality
analysis in KamLAND, potential pitfalls of this technique, and the
conditions that any similar experiment must meet to enable such a study.
