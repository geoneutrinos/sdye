<b>Abstract:</b>
This meeting will celebrate the first measurement of geo-antineutrinos, 
and at the same time it will initiate discussions on how to build a future 
super-sensitive detector that may be perhaps named "The Earth Tomograph." 
Antineutrinos may reveal unique and precious information about the 
structure and processes deep under the ground. This is possible because 
antineutrinos easily penetrate through the Earth. But at the same time the 
small cross section makes the detection of neutrinos notoriously 
difficult. To maximize the detection probability, the size of the 
next-generation detector(s) should greatly exceed the dimensions of the 
largest current experiments. In the construction of detectors on such a 
large scale, no other option remains than to use natural media: deep packs 
of ice, or, more likely, water. Charged particles that originate in 
impacts of primary neutrinos radiate Cherenkov or sometimes fluorescence 
light in transparent media. The created light traverses large distances 
before it finally reaches large arrays of photon detectors: the single 
most important detector element in this field.

Photosensors play an equally important role in other similar application 
areas that also search for rarely occurring phenomena, like in particle 
astrophysics, medical imaging and nuclear proliferation control. Unlike 
physics, the other application areas may present real, i.e. large and 
steady potential markets for new, inexpensive, high-quality, industrially 
mass-produced photosensors. Therefore they deserve special attention.
<br><br>
For various reasons, neither the current vacuum photosensor technology, 
nor the various modern semiconductor photosensor technologies may be 
suitable for such large-area mass applications. In contrast to the 
semiconductor photosensor technologies that have rapidly evolved during 
the last few decades (but towards small-pixel devices that are unsuitable 
for large-area and large-pixel applications), the vacuum photomultiplier 
tube (PMT) technology did not make any significant progress since the late 
1960s. The complex and bulky construction, and the labor-intensive 
manufacture are inherent to the PMT concept; mass production on the 
required scale is therefore virtually inconceivable, irrespective of cost. 
Also, intrinsic to the PMT concept are some important drawbacks in the PMT 
performance: low photoelectron collection efficiency (at most ~70% in 
large area PMTs); low quantum efficiency (20-25%), limited in addition 
only to a narrow spectral region; complicated and expensive installation 
methods; fragility (as dramatically experienced in the Super Kamiokande 
massive implosion disaster); high sensitivity to magnetic fields, and 
almost complete lack of single-photon resolution (i.e. of the ability to 
resolve the number of photons in a photosensor pixel).
<br><br>
In response to this well known problem, some new photosensor concepts have 
been proposed recently (few of them by the author of this paper). I will 
discuss novel photon detector technologies that may lead to inexpensive 
mass production for large markets, and may at the same time revolutionize 
neutrino and antineutrino detection, as well as proliferation control.
