<p><b>Title:</b> Geo-neutrinos in Borexino
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  Borexino, a low threshold real-time neutrino detector, 
is scheduled to start taking data at the end of 2006. Sensitivity to 
geo-neutrinos is favorable at the Borexino site thanks to the absence of 
nearby nuclear power plants. Expectations for geo-neutrino signals and 
related sensitivity will be presented.
