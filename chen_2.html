<b>Title:</b> Potassium Neutrino Detection
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> There is great interest in detecting the geo-neutrinos 
from potassium-40.  After uranium and thorium, potassium is the next most 
important radiogenic source of Earth's heat.  The possibility that 
substantial amounts of potassium reside in Earth's core makes detection of 
potassium geo-neutrinos all the more enticing.  A brief examination of 
possible ways to detect potassium-40 geo-neutrinos is presented.
