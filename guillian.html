<b>Title:</b> Nuclear Monitoring with a Gigaton Array of Antineutrino 
Detectors
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> The nuclear fuel used in fission bombs is highly enriched 
in plutonium-239,
which is produced in fission reactors via the capture of a neutron by
uranium-238. Reactors that produce weapons grade plutonium have a very
different fuel cycle compared to commercial nuclear reactors used to 
produce
electricity. Thus, fission reactors that are registered in the IAEA are
difficult to use to produce weapons grade plutonium. Any reactor that
produces serious amounts of weapons grade plutonium is likely to be
unregistered -- a rogue reactor. In this study, we considered the ability 
of
a global array of antineutrino detectors to detect such rogue reactors. 
The
array consists of 1596 10-megaton modules, each module using water doped
with 0.2% gadolinium as the target material. Antineutrinos are detected 
via
the inverse beta decay process. The modules are deployed in major bodies 
of
water where at least 2 km of shielding from cosmic rays is available. We
find that a rogue reactor deployed near large bodies of water is easily
detected with the array after an exposure time of several months. A rogue
reactor that is placed hundreds of miles inland can be detected after a
year's exposure if its power is about 1-2 GWth. The position of such a
reactor can be determined to within several hundred miles.
