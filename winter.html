<b>Title:</b>
``Neutrino tomography: Learning about the Earth's interior using the
propagation of neutrinos''
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> Because the propagation of neutrinos is affected by the 
presence 
of Earth matter, it opens new possibilities to probe the Earth's interior. 
Different approaches range from techniques based upon the interaction of 
high energy (TeV) neutrinos with Earth matter, to methods using the MSW 
effect on the neutrino oscillations of low energy (MeV to GeV) neutrinos.
 In principle, neutrinos from many different sources (sun, atmosphere, 
supernovae, beams etc.) can be used. In this talk, we summarize and 
compare different approaches, and we discuss the feasibility and 
competitiveness of individual developments.
