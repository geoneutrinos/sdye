<b>Abstract:</b>
We present predictions of geo-neutrino fluxes, for KamLAND and other 
locations, obtained within a reference BSE model.  
When considering more general models, in which the total Uranium and 
Thorium 
masses in the Earth are kept as free parameters, we show that a proximity 
argument provides a well defined connection between geo-neutrino flux and  
radiogenic heat production.<br><br>
We compare KamLAND results with theoretical predictions and then we 
discuss the size and location of geo-neutrino detectors which are 
needed for providing answers to the following questions:<br>
- How much Uranium and Thorium are in the Earth?<br>
- How are Uranium and Thorium distributed between Crust and Mantle?<br>
- Is there a radiogenic source in/near the core?<br>
