<b>Title:</b> 
SNO+ <br><br> 
<b>Abstract:</b> The Sudbury Neutrino 
Observatory will finish taking data with heavy water at the end of 2006.  
After the heavy water is removed in 2007, the detector could be filled 
with liquid scintillator.  SNO plus liquid scintillator (SNO+) would 
making an interesting geo-neutrino detector.  Sudbury is surrounded by 
Canadian Shield continental crust rock.  This provides a large 
geo-neutrino signal with a potentially well-determined local contribution.  
The closest nuclear power reactors are at a distance of 240 km and create 
a relatively small background.  SNO+ geo-neutrino studies would be an 
excellent near-term follow-up to KamLAND.
