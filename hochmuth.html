<b>Title:</b> Low Energy Neutrino Astrophysics- LENA
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
Geoneutrinos recently have become rather popular especially after KamLAND
has detected first events. The question is now if one can resolve the 
angular
distribution of these neutrinos in order to locate radioactive elements in
the earth.
In the talk some theoretical results as to how
an angular distribution spectrum of geoneutrinos might look like will be 
presented.
Conclusively the results shall be examined in the light of their
experimental detectability with the large volume liquid scintillator 
detector LENA.
